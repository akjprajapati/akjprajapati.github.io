This site is all about the technological and troubleshooting operations involved in IT.
Since the evolution of DevOps profile people started showing off their numenclature skills, they came up with several new profile names like DevOps, WebOps, SecOps, SysOps, CloudOps and many more. So I decided to unify them in one and I created this site cover all of them.
